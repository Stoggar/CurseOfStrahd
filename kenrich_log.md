# Mutiny!
Tensions were rising, but I newer expected it would come to this. 
They put chains around my feet and made me walk the plank. 
A fitting end for a pirate. 
When I sunk beneath the waves I felt strangely at peace.
Although death was close, I felt almost at home in the icy waters. 
When I hit the bottom of the ocean, the world seemed to change around me. 
I could breathe, and swim more easily than I could have dreamed of. 
The chains around my legs were gone, and I was.. a seal!
After exploring the sea-floor, I swam to shore and went to an inn.

# New friends!
I was hanging out in front of the inn, and there came three travelers in good spirits. 
The dwarf bought a keg of ale, for all of us. 
Ha! I think I love him. 

Suddenly a man in bright colors burst into the inn and gave us a letter from Burgmaster *Collin Amdirovitch*. 
It said his adoptive daughter was afflicted by evil, and he said all he owned would be ours if we agreed to help him out. 
Of course we shall! 
It is not often an oppertunity for treasure like that falls into your lap, and it would be legal to boot. 
The pirate life is behind me, but maybe I can still chase treasures. 

# Travel to Barovia
We go west through an old forest, and got to a gigantic gate.
When we went through, it closed shut behind us. 
These people are a brave lot, I wanted to turn back and find some way back through the gate, but we pushed on. 

We found a corpse beside the path, it had claw marks all over it. 
When we left the path, a wolf howled. 
It was getting closer, and I know it would not be friendly. 
The howling stopped when we got back on the path however. 
The corpse was clutching a letter, it was also from the Burgmaster, but this said it was too late, and not to come to Barovia. 

We got to a village, where we stayed at *Blood on the Vine* inn. 
This time Brie bought a keg of ale with a blue crystal she found on the corpse in the woods. 
A man waved us over.
He turned out to be Irenas brother, he wanted us to take her to Valaki to the west, as it would be safer for her. 

# is no fun, is no Blinksky
Since we came to the town we have heard sobbing from one of the houses here.
It turned out to come from a mother clutching a doll in her arms. 
The doll had the words *is no fun, is no Blinksky* written on it. 
The women misses her daughter *Gertruda* who she *kept safe* (creepy!) and has now escaped. 
We promised her to do all in our power to get back her missing daughter (I'm not sure what I've signed up for here). 

The man in the inn said he would come with us, but he left before wo got to bed.
