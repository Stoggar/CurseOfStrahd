## Midnight Ghosts!

I awoke in the middle of the night, and looking out the window I saw a small ghost-army! 
This place just gets creepier and creepier. 
I don't know what came over me, but my instinct was to follow them. 
I quickly woke the others, and jumped out of the window in cat-form. 
Alas this shapeshifting thing is still new to me, and I overestimated the dexterity I would have as a cat. 
Luckily, though I broke my foot as a cat, I was unharmed when I popped back into human shape. 
Only the embarrasment lingers. 
The ghosts didn't even notice, appearantly there was no need for stealth. 
We followed the ghosts around the town, and back to a hole in the graveyard, where they dissappeared. 


As we were searching the graveyard for anything curious, Hugo and Brie heard a cart moving in the street. 
We followed at a safe distance, Brie much closer than Hugo and me, that halfling is stealthy! 
It turned out to be an old woman selling pies. 
Only tonight she was collecting a debt. 
We saw her trying to kidnap a child! 
Appearantly it was as payment of the mothers debt. 
Hugo stepped in and stopped it, he's a good guy, that worries me a bit. 
Luckily there was no need for violence, and we even bought some "dream pies" from her. 
Appearantly they give you really nice dreams. 


We went back to the church and knocked on the door, but the priest inside was understandably sceptical to a gang of strangers in the middle of the night. 
Time for sleep anyways. 


## Church again

Back at the church, we discover that the priest is a bit loony. He keeps his son in the cellar because he's a bloodstarved vampire.
I gave him some of my blood, (this time I was the hero!). 
Afterwards he gave us all the information we wanted. 
Appearantly there was a wizard here once, a charismatic fellow, that rallied many Barovians to storm the castle at Ravenloft. 
This did not go well, hence the ghosts. 


## Back at the bar

We hadn't really noticed before, but the bartender here is odd. 
He just keeps wiping a glass with a dead look in his eyes. 
Ismark says he doesn't have a soul.
Appearantly it's a normal thing in Barovia. 
It's somethiing you can inherit from your parents. 
Ismark reminded us about his sister again, and we set out to the old Mayor's home. 


## Irena 

At the mayors home we met Irena. 
The mayor was in a coffin in the hallway, he had died of nervousness related to recent werewolf attacks. 
We took her uncle to the graveyard and buried him with the help of the priest. 
Afterwards we treated Irena to some pie, I'm not sure if we remembered to tell her about the... particular properties of this pie. 
I had the most amazing dreams that night. 
Back on the ship, with a fleet more at  our command, and riches beyond measure in the hold. 
I have trouble focusing on anything else, that pie was more addicting than anything else I've experienced. 
Hugo and Brie mentioned something about a man on the door during the night. 
He said he would come back, and it may be best not to be here when that happenes.
Appearantly Irena has been bitten twice already, and is worried what might happen if she's bit a third time. 
Anyway, we're taking Irena to Valaki, and Ismark is joining us. 


## On the road

We passed a crossroads, there were som gallows, we noticed nothing strange at first, but as we started walking there was suddenly a corpse hanging there. 
Brie was most distraught by this, she said it looked alot like her. 
This eerie realm can really set an imagination going I suppose. 


## Merry folk

We came upon a Vistani camp. 
The people there seemed nice and welcomed us around the bonfire with vine and a story. 
It was the same story the priests vampire son told us. 
A charismatic wizard, and a rebellion. 
Many soldiers fled, the rest were never heard from again. 
A magnificent fight between the wizard and the vampire lord, with magic and thunder. 
The wizard was hurtled 1000 ft. down, and washed away with the river. 


## Prophecies

We were encoraged to visit the tent of madam Eva, a fortune-teller, and have our futures told. 
It was very interesting, she seemed to know us the moment we stepped inside the tent. 
She put out som cards, told us their meaning and gave some advice on our next steps:

### first card

A powerful force for good and protection.

a holy symbol of hope.


A sleeping prince

a servant of light 

brother of darkness

The treasure rests with him. 

### second card

Strength and power

Weapon of vengance

A sword of sunlight


A fallen house, guarded by a stonedragon

Look for the highest point


### third card

Tells of history

Knowledge about the elder

Will help you understand your enemy


A throne fit for a king


### fourth card

Shows who can help us in the fight against darkness


Seek a disturbed young man

surrounded by riches and madness.

His home is his prison


### fifth card

Your enemy is a creature of darkness and beyond mortality


This card will lead you to him.

He lurks in the dark, 

where the light of dawn shone on a sacred place. 


### Interpretation

It seems like the first three are clues to some sources of power that can help us. 

The fourth is a clue to a potential ally. 

The fifth is a clue to where our enemy is.
