I scouted upstairs in the old windmill as a spider, and saw Morganta sweeping. 
There was white dust, leftover bones, and blood on her apron. 
On the next floor were two women with dresses made of flesh, they were dancing, and poking into cages with needles. 
Inside the cages: Two young children! 

The others were quick to action when I got back down, we decided to pretend someone was knocking on the door, so that maybe we could fight Morgantha without dealing with the other two just yet. 
It worked well enough, she answered the door, and we attacked. 
However we had not expected her to be as powerful as she was! 
I was knocked unconious the moment she turned around. 
However we succeeded in killing all three witches. 

Before turning in for the night, we wanted to get the dead bodies outside. 
Thinking back this was an obvious mistake. 
Hovewer Mahurren insisted on opening the door. 
When he did, he was dragged outside by Strahd! 
He wanted Irena again, and things got violent. 
He used a spell "Icecold Ice" and then a fireball, we were already tired from the fight with the witches, but we managed to get Mahuuren inside and close the door again. 

Irena picked up a strange bag and an amulet from the witches. 
As we walked along the road to Valaki, Mahurren spoke to a raven again. 
It was suspicious and didn't tell us much, even though he got some cheese. 
Luckily we found a decrepid house along the road to spend the night in. 
We had no visits (that we were aware of) from Strahd that night. 

When we got to the waters edge, we saw a man in a boat dump something overboard. 
We were just curious, and I decided to swim and pick it up. 
The contents of the bag horrified us all. 
It was a dead child. 
Recently dead, by drowning. 
Brie shot an arrow at the man in the boat. 
It hit his arm, yet he didn't react. 
We took another boat that was lying on the shore, and rowed over to him. 
Talking to him confirmed that he was one of the soulless fellows. 
We tried opening the strange bag next to him, and heard a sigh of relief as something escaped the bag. 
However it did not affect the man. 

We delivered the man to some guards in Valaki.
Appearantly he was the "town drunk". 
We also passed a closed shop named "Arasex Stockyard", and ended up in "Blue Water Inn", a bright and welcoming place. 
The innkeper told us about a shipment of wine that was missing. It should have arrived from "The Wizard of Wine's Winery". 
Irena has agreed to look after the children.
