# Catwoman 
Lady Fiona Vachter was home after all, she was just busy with some ritual in the basement. 
She and three other cultists were doing some ritual with the bones of saint Andrel. 
I returned upstairs after my scouting mission and discussed how to deal with the guards and get to Fiona. 
The discussion was interrupted however by evasdropping guards. 
We killed them quite brutally, and did the same with Fiona when we got downstairs. 
We got back upstairs and investigated a strange sound we heard earlier. 
"don't leave" it had said. 
We found the source of the sound after some knocking and wall-bashing, and it turned out to be a girl. 
She crawled around on all fours like a cat and escaped past us and all the way out of the estate. 
She was free. 

# Save the church!
We sprinted over to the church with the bones of saint Andrel. 
On the way we had to fight a vampire, he was pretty strong, but no match for the four of us. 
We spent the night there before heading to the mayors house for our reward. 

# Weapons against the darkness
At the mayor's house everyone were busy with preparations for the festival. 
The mayor however were pleased with our efforts, and was going to give us one silver weapon for our trouble. 
We felt we deserved more than one, and turns out Mahuuren can be very persuasive when shows his fangs. 
We left the place with one greatsword and one longsword, for Mahuuren and Hugo. 

# Bardic knowledge
We went to the inn to meet a bard and get more information about how to kill vampires. 
When we got there, we overheard some people talking about the girl in lady Fiona's estate. 
Turns out she was to be married to Vichtor (the mayor's son) but the rumors are that he said such horrible things to her, that she needed to be locked up. 
Doesn't make sense to me to lock someone up for acting like a cat, but what do I know. 

When we questioned the bard about how to kill vampires, he suddenly didn't want to talk. 
Questioning our motives. 
Appearantly things are not black and white here, the vampires must have some supporters. 

# Festival of the damned sun that won't burn
On the way to the festival, we met a guy saying "it's a conspiracy!", unfortunately when confronted with four heavily armed strangers, he wasn't keen to elaborate. 

When we arrived at the city square, they were getting ready to light up the sun-effigy. 
The first attempt to light it was unfortunately doused by a sudden rain. 
The mayor, who keeps proving he's even crazyer than I thought demanded three people as sacrifice. 
We tried pursuading him to stop, Hugo tried to pursuade the audience to revolt, and Mahuuren got angrier than I've ever seen him. 
Before a fight could break out between us however, some of Vachter's soldiers attacked the festival. 
We freed the prisoners and left town.
