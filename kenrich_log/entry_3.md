## Skeletal mystery

We spent the night in the tent of the seer Eva. 
The seer had a bag of coins just lying there in the tent. 
Before we left, we all saw Brie help herself to a handful of it. 
I'm surprised that I wasn't tempted; I've done worse, but then again I'm not used to taking from those who have helped me or shown such hospitality. 
More importantly, it revealed something about the group I'm traveling with. 
Brie might steal, but she doesn't get too greedy. 
Mahuuren took nothing, but also said nothing. 
Hugo, who seems to always want to do the right thing, did not stop his friend from doing as she pleased. 
I think I can trust these people. 

We continued along the path north, along a river. 
According to our map, it looked like our path would intersect with the road, but alas, when we got there a cliff separated us. 
So we continued to follow the river until we found a place that seemed moderately safe to cross. 
I took the lead as I could just shift into seal-form to easily outswim the current should the need arise. 
I tied a rope to the other end and swam back. 
When back at the other side, we saw a figure emerge from the woods. 
A skeletal man on a skeleton horse, holding a lantern that no longer held a light. 
Silence filled the air as the figure simply rode past us. 
We crossed the river afterwards (not completely without trouble), and set up camp on the other side. 

## Bang!
A man approached from the woods after we set up camp. 
The others were already sleeping, so I approached the man without waking them up. 
A decision I gradually began to regret. 
He had a pale countenance, red eyes, and introduced himself as Strahd. 
Luckily, he asked me to wake the others. 
When Irena saw him, she was so scared she jumped onto Mahuuren's back.
It seemed like she picked the right guy, for when Strahd asked us to hand her over, Mahuuren said "you'll have to go through us!". 
I'm not sure I would have made the same decision, but I know it's the right one. 
Strahd threw fire at us, which knocked out Irena. 
He then disappeared, leaving behind his so-called beloved Irena. 

## Bonegrinder mill
We decided to go to Bonegrinder Mill.
I have subtly been nudging the group in that direction.
Little did they know the real reason I wanted to go there is to try some more of those delicious pies. 
When we got there a raven squawked on the roof.
Appearantly Mahuuren can talk to animals, he said it was trying to warn us about some danger. 
Anyway, we knocked on the door, and the old woman named Morganta answered. 
We were eager to get inside so that we wouldn't meet Strahd again, so in the end she agreed to let us stay the night in exchange for 20 gold pieces. 
She told us not to go upstairs, and not to touch the pies that was cooling on the counter. 
Brie found some potions in a cabinet with some intresting labels:

- *Laughter*
- *Youth*
- *Mother's Milk*

I think I'm going to scout upstairs in spider-form and look around. 

<!-- 
I scouted upstairs as a spider, and saw Morganta sweeping. 
There was white dust, leftover bones and blood on her apron. 
On the next floor were two women with dresses made of flesh, they were dancing. 
Two children were there in cages. 
On the floor were piles of clothes. 

There was a ladder to the top floor. 
There was some old machinery there, and a birds nest. 

Morganta is dead, the two other witches are at the top of the stairs. -->
