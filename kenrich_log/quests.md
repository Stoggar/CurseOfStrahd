# What to do?

Barovia is a strange place, there is alot of things going on. 
If we are ever to get out of this place, maybe even help the people living here, I feel the need to write down some possible tracks we might follow. 


## Take Irina to Valaki
Irina has a problem: The intrest of the Vampire lord Strahd. She and her brother fears for her safety. 

We are traveling with her and her brother Ismark now. 


## Find Gertruda 
The crying woman in the Village of Barovia asked us to find her daughter. 


## The vampire son
Not sure there is anything to do here, but the son of the priest is still a vampire locked in the cellar of the church in the Village of Barovia. 


## Woman selling wonderful pie 
She tried to take a child as payment of debt. 
We should keep an eye out for her and her delicious pies. 
She lives by Bonegrinder Mill. 
It's on our way to Valaki. 


## Freek
We found a missing-poster for a boy named Freek.


## The wizard 
This is definetely intresting, maybe we should ask around more about the rebellion led by the charismatic wizard. 


## The Fortune teller
I wrote more about this in the second entry of my diary, but here are the main points:

1. Sleeping prince.
2. Sword of sunlight. 
3. Throne fit for a king.
4. Disturbed ung man surrounded by riches and madness.
5. Our enemy, where the light once shone on a holy place.
