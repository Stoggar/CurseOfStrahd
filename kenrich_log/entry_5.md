# Competitive Tea

We overheard someone talking at the Blue Water Inn, appearantly people are dissappearing. 
We heard about one that dissappeard after tearing down a rainbow-banner at a rainbow-festival, and one that dissappeared because appearantly he wasn't laughing enough. 
These might be rumours of townsfolk, but there's something really sinister going on here. 

After we left the inn we were soon approached by a messenger with an invitation to tea at Lady Fiona Wacther's mansion.
Later we recieved an invitation to the mayor's house at the excat same time. 
Appearantly the mayor is really busy, and it had to be at excatly 12, so we decided to go to Fiona early. 
On the way there we passed a very flammable-looking installation of something that looked like an imitation of a sun. 

# Lady Fiona 

We were met by an elderly servant that took us in to see Fiona. She's a regal woman in her 50s. 
In her company was some burly, tired, serious-looking guys in their 20s. 
She wanted to overtrhow the mayor, and promised us protection (thinly veiled threat) if we assist her. 
She also offered us a place to stay. 


# The Mayor's Son

Creepy guy! He seems like he means well, but he really is convinced that the darkness can be held at bay if everyone are just cheerful enough. 
We can't be sure he's behind the dissappearances though.
I suspect there is more to this. 
Anyway, he wanted help against Fiona, saying she's the leader of a Strahd-worshipping cult. 
We are to bring him evidence that she's in kahoots with Strahd. 
We told him about the inkeeper and the missing wine, and he promised to deliver from his own stores. 

We visited his son, Victor, who seems to fit the description from the prophecy.

*Seek a disturbed young man  
Surrounded by riches and madness.  
His home is his prison*

The mayor say they're trying to shelter him, but had no issues with us seeing him. 
He was in the attic, the air from his room smelled like chemicals and magic. 
"Have you come to take me away again? I don't want any more pills"
Definitely a disturbed man. 
We had to bring Irena for him to trust us, when we did he revealed what his been working on. 
He's trying to capture a glimt of "real sun", but he's missing an ingredient: A wine called "sun's blood" blessed by the Morning Lords priests. 
Looks like we're headed to the Wizard of Wine's Winery after all. 

# The Church

Next we visited the church, since Irena thought she would be safer there. 
There we found out the church had been protected by the "holy bones of saint Andrel". 
We discovered the bones were stolen by a boy named Milliroy, on behalf of Fiona, because he needed money. 

The mayor was not satisfied with just this information, he wanted us to retrieve the bones. 
So we decided to take Fiona up on her offer to let us stay at her place. 
She was not home when we got there, but we were shown in and led to living-quarters in the cellar. 
I have decided to scout downstairs as a spider.
